***Progress Bar Project -JavaScript***

**Project Summary:**

The project involves creating a dynamic progress bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Upon clicking a start button, the progress bar will visually load to 100%. Subsequently, a success message will be displayed, indicating completion of the progress.

Additionally, the project includes implementing a feature where the background color changes when the mouse hovers over certain elements on the webpage.

To achieve this, we'll use HTML for structuring the webpage, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity.

The HTML file will define the structure of the webpage, including the start button, progress bar container, and message display area.

CSS will be used to style the elements, defining the appearance of the progress bar, button, and background.

JavaScript will handle the functionality of the progress bar, listening for button clicks to trigger the loading animation and success message display. It will also implement the background color change on mouse hover.

**Key functionalities will include:**

Creating a responsive and visually appealing progress bar using CSS.
Implementing event handling in JavaScript to initiate progress bar loading and display success message.
Adding interactivity with mouse hover events to change background colors dynamically.
Ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices.
The project will follow best practices in web development, including modular code design, separation of concerns, and accessibility considerations.

Testing will be conducted to ensure smooth behavior across various scenarios, including button clicks, animation transitions, and responsiveness.

The completed project will serve as a practical demonstration of front-end development techniques, suitable for educational purposes or as a component in larger web applications.

Overall, the goal is to create a polished and functional progress bar application that showcases the capabilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while providing an engaging user experience.
